# `xcrun actool`, with its arguments passed through untouched — and **what it leaves behind taken back**.
#
# A helper actool spawns renders the app icon into a UUID-named directory under the per-user temporary
# directory and never removes it: one `<AppIcon>1024x1024_….png` per compile, for good. `TMPDIR` does
# not reach the helper — measured 2026-10-03, set to a scratch directory, the render still landed in the
# real one — so it cannot be steered, only collected. The renders this compile made are found by a
# marker taken just before it, removed with their directory where nothing else is in it, and the run
# fails if one survives: a leak that is quiet is a leak that returns.
#
# Every actool call in this repository goes through here: the bundle build and the icon tests both
# leaked, and a cleanup written twice is a cleanup that drifts.
#
# Not safe to run two at once: each would collect the other's render. Nothing here does — the bundle
# build holds its lock and the test suites run one after another.
